# Botranktir

## Description

Botranktir is a Discord bot that assign or unassign roles after reacting or removing the reaction on a message.  
The bot is available for everybody to use.

Data are cached and accessing the database is done only on adding a new reaction role, removing an existing
reaction role or when the bot is loaded. This provides a huge advantage of a very low amount of queries to
the database and thus, the bot reacts much faster.

- `role` - the name of a role or a mentioned role

#### Examples

- `{prefix}addrole #welcome 580458877531979786 :truckersmp: Subscriber`

> External emotes can be used, too. However, before using the command, react with the external emoji as first.
